            Hi, my name is Henry. I am a retired Engineer (graduated from UWA). I can help your kids achieve those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can help students with their school curriculum Maths, NAPLAN, ATAR and Competition preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can help them perform to their highest potential; be the best they can be! I will teach students various skills such as: how to go about solving problems, logical reasoning, lateral thinking, and analysing problems systematically etc., all of which are especially important in Maths competitions and Scholarship tests.
        </p>

                        <p>Henry tutored my daughter in maths. Her skills improved so much during this time. Henry was always punctual and obliging if we needed to change dates for any reason. </p>
                        <p>He made the learning relaxed and was always bright and good humoured. </p>
                        <p>Would highly recommend him for tutoring</p>

His friendly, approachable nature has made it very easy for my son to feel comfortable with him. Henry always has a smile on his face, is on time and easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend his services.</p>
