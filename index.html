            Hi, my name is Henry. I am a retired Engineer (graduated from UWA). I can help your kids achieve those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can help students with their school curriculum Maths, NAPLAN, ATAR and Competition preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can help them perform to their highest potential; be the best they can be! I will teach students various skills such as: how to go about solving problems, logical reasoning, lateral thinking, and analysing problems systematically etc., all of which are especially important in Maths competitions and Scholarship tests.
        </p>

                        <p>Henry tutored my daughter in maths. Her skills improved so much during this time. Henry was always punctual and obliging if we needed to change dates for any reason. </p>
                        <p>He made the learning relaxed and was always bright and good humoured. </p>
                        <p>Would highly recommend him for tutoring</p>

                        <p>Henry has been a great help to my son who started high school last year and struggled with his Maths. His friendly, approachable nature has made it very easy for my son to feel comfortable with him. Henry always has a smile on his face, is on time and easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend his services.</p>

                        <p>Henry has been my son's maths tutor since 2nd semester. My son was struggling with maths to the point he was getting zero in every maths test. Henry was a god send to me, I can’t thank him enough, from a D grade, to a B+ in one semester! Henry is a very patient teacher where he makes maths fun for my son, my son used to hate maths till Henry came into the picture! My son is getting test results back at average 87% or higher… thank you Henry for all your efforts 😊</p>
